# c74expo-IoT-Sonification

This repository was created for the C74 Expo 2019 workshop "Cellular IoT Development using Node.js and Twilio" at MassMoCA in North Adams, MA.

## Why?
The purpose of the workshop was to briefly discuss the history of modems and how they relate to our everyday life regarding IoT development. Then from there demonstrate how to program a microcontroller using a Twilio SIM and send Commands from the board to Max8, where the data is sonified based on participant locations in the workshop.

## Repository Contents
* Assets
  * Images and content from the workshop describe IoT workflows.
* Examples
  * Arduino examples that demonstrate how to send and receive Machine-to-Machine messages using various off-the-shelf microcontrollers.
    * Arduino MKR 1400, Wio LTE, Adafruit FONA 3G, Adafruit Feather 32u4 FONA
* Project
  * The Max8 patched and Node.js file used to collect the SIM data in real-time during the workshop.
